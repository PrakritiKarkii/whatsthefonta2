            <p>“Be Alright” is a deep and meaningful song about the hardships of a break-up. Completely destroyed, Dean goes to a friend for help who offers the very painful, but necessary advice to move on.

                In an interview with The Music Dean explained the song was not literally about him:
                
                For people worried about me because the song is so sad – trust me I’m OK. The song is actually about hope and knowing that in the end things will work out, surrounding yourself with good people
                
                The track was released in June 2018 as the lead single from his forthcoming debut studio album, after the release of his debut EP Same Kind Of Different in 2017. A month later the music video surfaced. “Be Alright” reached number one and was certified double platinum in Australia, the home country of the singer.
                
                On 7 September 2018 an acoustic version of the song was released.</p>

        <div class="verse1">
            <p>I look up from the ground</p>
            <p>To see your sad and teary eyes</p>
            <p>You look away from me</p>
            <p>And I see there's something you're trying to hide</p>
            <p>And I reach for your hand but it's cold</p>
            <p>You pull away again</p>
            <p>And I wonder what's on your mind</p>
            <p>And then you say to me you made a dumb mistake</p>
            <p>You start to tremble and your voice begins to break</p>
       <p>You say the cigarettes on the counter weren't your friend's</p>
            <p>They were my mate's</p>
            <p>And I feel the colour draining from my face</p>
          
        </div>
        <div class="chorus">

                <p>And my friend said</p>
                <p>"I know you love her, but it's over, mate</p>
                <p>It doesn't matter, put the phone away</p>
                <p>It's never easy to walk away, let her go</p>
                <p>It'll be alright"</p>

        <div class="verse2">
       <p>So I still look back at all the messages you'd sent</p>
        <p>And I know it wasn't right, but it was fucking with my head</p>
        <p>And everything deleted like the past, yeah, it was gone</p>
        <p>And when I touched your face, I could tell you're moving on</p>
        <p>But it's not the fact that you kissed him yesterday</p>
        <p>It's the feeling of betrayal, that I just can't seem to shake</p>
        <p>And everything I know tells me that I should walk away</p>
        <p>But I just wanna stay</p>

        <p>It's never easy to walk away, let her go</p>
        <p>It'll be okay</p>
        <p>It's gonna hurt for a bit of time</p>
        <p>So bottoms up, let's forget tonight</p>
        <p>You'll find another and you'll be just fine</p>
